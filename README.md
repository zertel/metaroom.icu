The Metaroom.icu project, in a nutshell, allows you to effectively use all the devices in your home. (But why should we do this? Take a look at the examples below).



The ultimate goal
- Ability to focus multiple devices (regardless of type) on one point.
- Speeding up life with very weak clients, thanks to rendering that runs entirely on the server.
- Enabling the user to produce very simple applications or unlimited projects with production tools and make them available to humanity.
- Enabling the sharing of experience between users without limited patterns.
- Providing infrastructure for the transition from personal Metaroom to leapable Metaverse.
- Bringing security and convenience to commercial experiences with Web3 smart contract support.

The Metaroom.icu project is a new project that started to be planned on July 30, 2024 and has not yet established its intended use, mission and vision.
I think that as the pieces fall into place over time, it will provide solutions to the needs of people that have not yet been felt.

Thanks to the free software license, it is my hope that it will become an unbreakable standard that belongs to all humanity.

We can think of the keyword Metaroom as the virtual reflection of each household (a person's home or a family home). When all the devices in a house are connected to a single room, all the features of the devices become available to other devices in that room (whether it is a local network or not).

The word Metaroom is not specific to the Metaroom.icu project, it is a term proposed for common use.
Developers using the Metaroom.icu project as a framework are encouraged to use the “.icu” domain extension (if they intend to use a domain address).
Every metaroom is like a monster with too many ears and cameras. This is why the I.C.U joke should be kept in mind.
Metaroom security updates should be worked on, just like operating systems, with the fact that feedback from all developers and users is crucial for the real security of metarooms.


A simple example of using Metaroom;
- A family of 4 people lives in a house.
- There is a computer, a smart TV, 3 cell phones, 3 tripods for cell phones.
- They joined a metaroom by typing https://<any-metaroom>.icu in the web browsers of the phones and entered a secret and private room in the metaroom.
- They placed the phones on the tripods with the phone cameras facing the center of the living room.
- They allowed https://<any-metaroom>.icu to use the cameras of the phones.
- Then they turned on the computer and joined the same metaroom.
- On the computer they opened the “3d dress scanner tool” developed by the metaroom project https://<any-metaroom>.icu.
- The sweet daughter of the family, wearing a one-piece dress, accidentally created a 3d model of her dress while passing through the point where the cameras were looking. (what are we going to do with this model, is it useful for the store that sells the dress? We better share this 3d model with the store owner. no, I don't know if the store owner has an account in this project, so let's enter his e-mail address.)
- But I think we forgot one thing, the energetic son of the family set up the 3 camera setup to swing a sword in the knight game on the smart TV screen in the same metaroom. But why doesn't he use the same metaroomed Virtual Reality Goggles (maybe he feels nauseous)?
- So, how about adding some fun to the game? Maybe it would be better to let the sound from one of the phones' microphones stream into the game in the metaroom (maybe when swinging a sword, if you shout loudly, the enemy monsters might get scared and run away).
- Or using 2 phones, allowing 2 microphones to stream sound, and starting a stereo sound recording, it could provide a more realistic sound stream. 
- Or 3 microphones? Or 4? Oh no, the TV doesn't have a microphone. Wait a minute, the computer has a microphone! 
- So turn the computer screen towards the boy so he can follow his player's HP bar there. I think we should put the mission guide on that screen too, so that the TV screen looks clean.

Another example;
- We want to draw a picture as a family, so let's turn on the TV, the children take their tablets, we take our phones.
- All devices have the same screen, but it doesn't matter, everyone is looking at the TV screen and painting on the huge canvas. (or everything could be mixed up, whatever).
- This metaroom project includes the LLM model, so shouldn't the little girl of the house cheat? (girl: “hey ai, can you draw me a butterfly?”, ai: “it's the year 2200, you're still asking me this question? Hey anyway, I guess I'd better start with the word ‘sure!’ like my great great grandfather used to do and get on with it...”)


Another example;
- In one house, there was a coffee machine connected to the internet... (Coffee machine: Leave me alone! Go play a game on TV or something! I don't want the internet or a room, give me coffee, I don't care about the rest...)
- Well, okay, maybe we need to think a bit more about the Internet of Things...
